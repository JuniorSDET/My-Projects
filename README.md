# Bank Loan Analysis Using SQL and Power BI

Project Summary: Bank Loan Analysis Using SQL and Power BI

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to gain insights into loan performance, customer behavior, and financial metrics. By leveraging  SQL for data extraction, transformation, and analysis, and Power BI for visualization and reporting, the project provides a comprehensive view of loan portfolios, including good and bad loans, financial metrics, and customer risk profiles.

Total Loan Applications:
   The total number of loan applications received by the bank.
   This metric helps understand the demand for loans and the bank's market reach.

Total Funded Amount:
   The total amount of money disbursed by the bank as loans.
   This reflects the bank's lending activity and financial commitment.

Total Amount Received:
   The total amount repaid by borrowers, including principal and interest.
   This metric indicates the bank's revenue generation from loans.

Good Loans vs. Bad Loans:
 Good Loans: Loans that are performing well, with borrowers making timely repayments.
 Bad Loans: Loans that are delinquent, defaulted, or at risk of non-repayment.
The analysis highlights the percentage of good and bad loans, providing insights into the bank's loan portfolio health.


Interest Rate:
The average interest rate charged on loans.
 This metric is crucial for understanding the bank's profitability and the cost of borrowing for customers.

Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:
The average DTI ratio of borrowers, which measures the percentage of a borrower's income used to repay debts. A high DTI ratio indicates higher financial risk for borrowers, while a low DTI ratio suggests better financial stability.

Insights and Findings:

Loan Portfolio Health
   - The analysis reveals the proportion of good loans versus bad loans, helping the bank identify areas of risk and take proactive measures to reduce defaults.
   - For example, if bad loans constitute a significant portion of the portfolio, the bank may need to tighten lending criteria or improve collection processes.

Financial Performance
   - The total funded amount and total amount received provide a clear picture of the bank's lending activity and revenue generation.
   - The interest rate analysis helps assess whether the bank's pricing strategy aligns with market conditions and profitability goals.

Customer Risk Assessment
   - The DTI ratio analysis helps identify high-risk borrowers who may struggle to repay their loans.
   - This information can be used to refine credit scoring models and improve loan approval processes.
