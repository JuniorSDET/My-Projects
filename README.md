# Bank Loan Analysis Using SQL and Power BI

Project Summary: Bank Loan Analysis Using SQL and Power BI

Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to gain insights into loan performance, customer behavior, and financial metrics. By leveraging  SQL for data extraction, transformation, and analysis, and Power BI for visualization and reporting, the project provides a comprehensive view of loan portfolios, including good and bad loans, financial metrics, and customer risk profiles.

Total Loan Applications:
   The total number of loan applications received by the bank.
   This metric helps understand the demand for loans and the bank's market reach.

Total Funded Amount:
   The total amount of money disbursed by the bank as loans.
   This reflects the bank's lending activity and financial commitment.

Total Amount Received:
   The total amount repaid by borrowers, including principal and interest.
   This metric indicates the bank's revenue generation from loans.

Good Loans vs. Bad Loans:
 Good Loans: Loans that are performing well, with borrowers making timely repayments.
 Bad Loans: Loans that are delinquent, defaulted, or at risk of non-repayment.
The analysis highlights the percentage of good and bad loans, providing insights into the bank's loan portfolio health.

Interest Rate:
The average interest rate charged on loans.
 This metric is crucial for understanding the bank's profitability and the cost of borrowing for customers.

Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio:
The average DTI ratio of borrowers, which measures the percentage of a borrower's income used to repay debts. A high DTI ratio indicates higher financial risk for borrowers, while a low DTI ratio suggests better financial stability.

Insights and Findings:

Loan Portfolio Health
   - The analysis reveals the proportion of good loans versus bad loans, helping the bank identify areas of risk and take proactive measures to reduce defaults.
   - For example, if bad loans constitute a significant portion of the portfolio, the bank may need to tighten lending criteria or improve collection processes.

Financial Performance
   - The total funded amount and total amount received provide a clear picture of the bank's lending activity and revenue generation.
   - The interest rate analysis helps assess whether the bank's pricing strategy aligns with market conditions and profitability goals.

Customer Risk Assessment
   - The DTI ratio analysis helps identify high-risk borrowers who may struggle to repay their loans.
   - This information can be used to refine credit scoring models and improve loan approval processes.

# Health care Emergency Room Project

The goal of this project was to develop an interactive and insightful dashboard for a hospital emergency room (ER) using SQL for data extraction and Tableau for visualization. The dashboard aims to provide real-time insights into key performance metrics such as wait times, patient satisfaction scores, number of patients, and overall patient flow to improve operational efficiency and patient care.

Average wait time for patients from arrival to being seen by a healthcare provider.

Breakdown of wait times by triage level (e.g., critical, urgent, non-urgent).

Trends in wait times over time (hourly, daily, weekly).

Average satisfaction score based on post-visit surveys.

Correlation between wait times and satisfaction scores.

Identification of areas for improvement based on patient feedback.

Number of Patients:

Total number of patients visiting the ER daily, weekly, and monthly.

Patient volume by time of day and day of the week to identify peak hours.

Comparison of patient volume against hospital capacity.

Patient Flow:

Average time spent in the ER from admission to discharge or transfer.

Bottlenecks in patient flow (e.g., delays in lab results or consultations).

# Health Care Statistics

Project Summary: Health Clinic Patient Screening Analysis Using SQL and Tableau
Objective:
The goal of this project is to analyze patient screening data for a health clinic, focusing on demographic factors such as race, region, and language, to identify trends and disparities in healthcare access and utilization. The analysis will leverage SQL for data extraction and manipulation, and Tableau for visualization and reporting.
